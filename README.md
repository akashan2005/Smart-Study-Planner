PROBLEM STATEMENT
  Students often struggle to organize their academic activities, leading to missed deadlines, incomplete tasks, and 
poor time management. Existing tools are either too complex, non-customizable, or not tailored for student 
needs.
  There is a need for a simple, visually engaging, and easy-to-use digital planner that integrates:
 ❖ Task management (to-do lists, deadlines)
 ❖ Notes and resource storage
 ❖ Calendar scheduling
 ❖ Focus timers for productivity
 ❖ Personal diary for reflections
  This solution should provide a lightweight, customizable, and centralized platform to improve students’ 
productivity and academic outcomes.

SYSTEM APPROACH
  Frontend Technologies
 o HTML5 – Page structure (Login, Dashboard, Modules).
 o CSS3 – Styling, themes, responsive layouts.
 o JavaScript – Navigation, interactivity, theme toggle, focus timer.
  Design Approach
 o Modular pages: Login, Dashboard, Tasks, Subjects, Calendar, Diary, Focus Mode.
 o Clean & modern UI with colourful cards and background themes.
 o Mobile-responsive grid layout for easy access across devices.
 o User-friendly interface with simple navigation and motivational quotes.
